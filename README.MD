```javascript
import {RecoilRoot} from 'recoil-perist';

//... normal setup, import components etc.

const App = () => {
    return (
        <RecoilRoot loading={null}>
            <RootComponent />
        </RecoilRoot>

loading prop: The provided loading value will be rendered until persistence is complete at which point children will be rendered.
function children: The function will be invoked with a single
